There is a great math explanation in chapter 3 of Michael Neilson’s deep learning [book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap3.html), but for now I’ll simply say it’s because our prediction function is non-linear (due to sigmoid transform). Squaring this prediction as we do in MSE results in a non-convex function with many local minimums. If our cost function has many local minimums, gradient descent may not find the optimal global minimum.\n",
